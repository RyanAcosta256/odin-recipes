    <p class ="desc">a classic itatlian dessert that is perfect to eat with a nice cup of coffee and should strictly be made per tradition and with no chocolate chips</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Indgredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1.5 cups cold espresso</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur</li>
        <li>1 package Lady Fingers</li>
        <li>Espresso powder for dusting the top</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subheader">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</li>
        
        <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan. </li>
        
        <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>

        <li>Dust Espresso powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
    </ol>
